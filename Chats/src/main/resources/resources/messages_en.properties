# For formatting codes, use '\u00a7' with the Minecraft formatting code at the end.
# examples:
# - example=\u00a74Example Text   -> makes the text dark red.
# - example=\u00a7lExample Text   -> makes the text bold.
#
# For announce messages, the {0} Placeholder represents the channel color and so can be used to color the message in
# the channel color.
#
# For listing messages, the last formatting code in the message is used to format the entries of the listing.
